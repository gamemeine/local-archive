## Project Goal
The main goal of the project is to collect, securely store, and share valuable materials
such as photographs and descriptions that document the development and transformation of the local environment. 
Additionally, the project addresses the need for privacy protection by allowing users to mark uploaded content as either public or private. 
It also introduces an on-demand sharing mechanism that preserves the anonymity of the data owner.
